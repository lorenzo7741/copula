# Meta-Gaussian Copula Multivariate Model for Log Returns 

This code takes two prices and fits a Meta-Gaussian Copula Multivariate Model to the Log Returns of the prices. After fitting the model, the code also generates several plots to visualize the data and analysis results.

## Libraries Required
- pandas
- pandas_datareader
- numpy
- scipy
- MetaGaussianMultivariate
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Use
1. Define the required libraries.
2. Select the date range and define the symbols for which the price data will be obtained.
3. Combine all data obtained from each symbol and drop missing values.
4. Calculate the Log Returns of the combined data using the natural logarithm function in numpy.
5. Fit the Meta-Gaussian Multivariate model to the Log Returns data.
6. Visualize the data by generating four scatter plots:
    * The first one plots the Prices of both symbols.
    * The second one plots the Log Returns of both symbols.
    * The third one plots the CDF Normal vs CDF Empirical $/£.
    * The fourth one plots the CDF Normal vs CDF Empirical $/€.  
    These plots are intended to serve as a visual comparison between the distributions of the data to see if there is a match between normal and empirical distributions.
7. Generate a final scatter plot that shows the Random Variables from Multivariate Normal for the given data.

## Output
- Four scatter plots generated to visualize the data and the analysis made.
- PNG files are saved for each plot.

See the [plot.png](plot.png) file for an example of the resulting plot generated by the code.

## Copula

In probability theory, a copula is a mathematical object used to describe the dependence between two or more random variables, without taking their marginal distributions into account. In other words, a copula represents the joint distribution of a set of random variables as a uniform distribution over the unit square/cube, factoring in their dependence structure separate from their marginal distributions.

Suppose $X = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_d)$ is a random vector with continuous marginal distributions on $[0,1]$, where $d$ is the number of variables. The Copula $C$ of $X$ is a function $C : [0,1]^d \rightarrow [0,1]$ that satisfies the following properties:

1. $C$ is a multidimensional cumulative distribution function (CDF) with uniform marginals.
2. $C$ is a dependency structure that describes the probability distribution of a set of variables.
3. $C$ is Sklar's Theorem compatible, i.e., it links the marginal distribution functions of a random vector to its joint distribution through a copula.

## Sklar's Theorem

Sklar's Theorem is a fundamental theorem in the theory of copulas and provides a way to uniquely decompose any multivariate distribution function into univariate distributions and a copula. The theorem states:

- For any multivariate distribution function H(x₁, x₂, ..., xn), there exist unique marginal distribution functions Fi and a unique copula C(u₁, u₂, ..., un) such that:

\begin{equation}
H(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) = C(F_1(x_1), F_2(x_2), \cdots, F_n(x_n)), \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; x_1 \in \mathbb{R}, \cdots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
where the marginal distribution functions Fi are uniquely defined, continuous and non-decreasing.

## Gaussian Copulae

The Gaussian Copula is a special type of copula that uses a Gaussian distribution (normal distribution) to model the dependency structure between random variables. The Gaussian Copula has become increasingly popular in finance as a tool to measure credit risk and to calculate Value at Risk (VaR). A multivariate normal distribution with correlation matrix C can be expressed as a Gaussian copula with covariance matrix Σ, where Σ is any matrix such that ΣΣ^T = C.

Each element of the correlation matrix for a Gaussian Copula is bounded between -1 and 1. The parameter ρ represents the correlation coefficient between the two variables, and is given

```math
C(u_1, u_2) = \Phi_{\rho}\Big(\Phi^{-1}(u_1),\Phi^{-1}(u_2)\Big),
```
where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are parts of the standard multivariate normal random vector with correlation matrix $C$, $\Phi(z)$ is the standard
normal cumulative distribution function, and $\Phi _\rho(u_1,u_2)$ is the bivariate normal cumulative distribution
function with correlation coefficient $\rho$.
