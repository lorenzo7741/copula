# Copula Repository
Repo with multivariate copula classes and calibration methods
The Repo contains:
- A class MetaGaussianMultivariate: Class for a multivariate meta-gaussian copula random variable. The class provide functions to fit and 
    simulate these kind of copulas
- fx_rates_application: an application of the MetaGaussianMultivariate class to the pair of 
exchange rates $/£ and £/€.
## An application of Multivariate Meta-Gaussian Copula Model for Log Returns of exchange rate \$/\£ and \$/€
This is an example of how a meta-Gaussian copula can be fitted to a pair of prices that shows
a correlation and a fat-tails effect. This specific example was build on two 
historical series: the exchange rate $/£ and the exchange rate $/€. The historical series 
are provided by FRED Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), that is a database maintained by 
the Research division of the Federal Reserve Bank. The code is all available in fx_rates_application.py
Let's see the procedure:

### 1. The historical series
This are the prices:

This is a scatter plot of the log returns and a compareson between each ECDF and its
 respective Gaussian normal cumulative density function with the mean and standar
  deviation of the respective sample.



## Output
- Four scatter plots generated to visualize the data and the analysis made.
- PNG files are saved for each plot.

See the [plot.png](plot.png) file for an example of the resulting plot generated by the code.


## Copula

In probability theory, a copula is a mathematical object used to describe the dependence between two or more random variables, without taking their marginal distributions into account. In other words, a copula represents the joint distribution of a set of random variables as a uniform distribution over the unit square/cube, factoring in their dependence structure separate from their marginal distributions.

Suppose $X = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_d)$ is a random vector with continuous marginal distributions on $[0,1]$, where $d$ is the number of variables. The Copula $C$ of $X$ is a function $C : [0,1]^d \rightarrow [0,1]$ that satisfies the following properties:

1. $C$ is a multidimensional cumulative distribution function (CDF) with uniform marginals.
2. $C$ is a dependency structure that describes the probability distribution of a set of variables.
3. $C$ is Sklar's Theorem compatible, i.e., it links the marginal distribution functions of a random vector to its joint distribution through a copula.

## Sklar's Theorem

Sklar's Theorem is a fundamental theorem in the theory of copulas and provides a way to uniquely decompose any multivariate distribution function into univariate distributions and a copula. The theorem states:

- For any multivariate distribution function H(x₁, x₂, ..., xn), there exist unique marginal distribution functions Fi and a unique copula C(u₁, u₂, ..., un) such that:

\begin{equation}
H(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) = C(F_1(x_1), F_2(x_2), \cdots, F_n(x_n)), \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; x_1 \in \mathbb{R}, \cdots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
where the marginal distribution functions Fi are uniquely defined, continuous and non-decreasing.

## Gaussian Copulae

The Gaussian Copula is a special type of copula that uses a Gaussian distribution 
(normal distribution) to model the dependency structure between random variables.
 The Gaussian Copula has become increasingly popular in finance as a tool to measure 
 credit risk and to calculate Value at Risk (VaR). A multivariate normal distribution 
 with correlation matrix C can be expressed as a Gaussian copula with covariance
  matrix $Σ, where $Σ is any matrix such that $ΣΣ^T = C$.

Each element of the correlation matrix for a Gaussian Copula is bounded between -1 and 1. The parameter ρ represents the correlation coefficient between the two variables, and is given

```math
C(u_1, u_2) = \Phi_{\rho}\Big(\Phi^{-1}(u_1),\Phi^{-1}(u_2)\Big),
```
where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are parts of the standard multivariate normal random vector with correlation matrix $C$, $\Phi(z)$ is the standard
normal cumulative distribution function, and $\Phi _\rho(u_1,u_2)$ is the bivariate normal cumulative distribution
function with correlation coefficient $\rho$.
